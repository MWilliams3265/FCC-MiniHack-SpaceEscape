# EarthEscape
## Overview
Evil Donny has screwed the pooch and Earth is on its way out. You must gather
enough supplies to build a rocket and get off of the planet and try to escape
to the newly discovered Trappist system.

Will you find enough supplies? Will a planet be inhabitable? Will you be able to
save the human race?
